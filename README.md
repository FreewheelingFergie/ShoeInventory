# PROJECT NAME: shoe_inventory

### DESCRIPTION: 
As part of my Software Engineering Bootcamp, I was asked to develop a Python program that will
read from a text file containing an inventory of shoes. The Python program should perform various functions 
and present the results to managers.

### CONTENTS:
1. Task Functions
1. Installation Instructions
1. Usage
1. Credits

#### TASK FUNCTIONS:
The task required a menu which provided the following functions:
1. Allow the user to capture data about a shoe and use this data to create a shoe object and append this object inside the shoe list.
1. All the user to iterate over the shoe list and print the details of the shoe returned.
1. A re-stock function which allows the user to find the shoe object with the lowest quantity and allow the user to add to the quantity.
1. Search for a particular shoe using the shoe code.
1. Calculate the total value for each item.


#### USAGE:
The program is very simple to use and will present the user with a menu. 
The user should then select the corresponding value from the menu for the required action (as per the below screen shot).

For example, in order for the user to view all products in the shoe inventory, they should enter option '2' followed by the return key.
This will provide a view similar to the below:

Where a user is required to enter further information, they will be prompted by the program. An example being when the user wishes to add a new product.

As per the above screenshot, you can see that the program has prompted the user for key details such as cost and quantity. 

These details are then summarised before returning the user to the main menu. 

Where a user inputs an incorrect menu option, they will be returned to the main menu to try again.

#### CREDITS:
This program was a requirement of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp.
HyperionDev provided a basic invenotry text file which has since been added to whilst testing the functionality.
The Python program was produced by Ewan Ferguson.
